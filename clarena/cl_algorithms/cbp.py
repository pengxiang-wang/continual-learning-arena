class CBP(Finetuning):
    r"""[CBP (Continual Backpropagation)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07711-7) algorithm.

    A continual learning approach that reinitializes a small number of units during training, using an utility measures to determine which units to reinitialize. It aims to address loss of plasticity problem for learning new tasks, yet not very well solve the catastrophic forgetting problem in continual learning.

    We implement CBP as a subclass of Finetuning algorithm, as CBP has the same `forward()`, `training_step()`, `validation_step()` and `test_step()` method as `Finetuning` class.
