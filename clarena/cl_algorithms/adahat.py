    An architecture-based continual learning approach that improves [HAT (Hard Attention to the Task)](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/serra18a) by introducing adaptive soft gradient clipping based on parameter importance and network sparsity.

    We implement AdaHAT as a subclass of HAT, as it shares the same `forward()`, `compensate_task_embedding_gradients()`, `training_step()`, `on_train_end()`, `validation_step()`, and `test_step()` methods as the `HAT` class.

        **Args:**
        - **backbone** (`HATMaskBackbone`): must be a backbone network with the HAT mask mechanism.
        - **heads** (`HeadsTIL`): output heads. AdaHAT supports only TIL (Task-Incremental Learning).
        - **adjustment_mode** (`str`): the strategy of adjustment (i.e., the mode of gradient clipping), must be one of:
            1. 'adahat': set gradients of parameters linking to masked units to a soft adjustment rate in the original AdaHAT approach (allows slight updates on previous-task parameters). See Eqs. (8) and (9) in Sec. 3.1 of the [AdaHAT paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-70352-2_9).
            2. 'adahat_no_sum': as above but without parameter-importance (i.e., no summative mask). See Sec. 4.3 (ablation study) in the [AdaHAT paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-70352-2_9).
            3. 'adahat_no_reg': as above but without network sparsity (i.e., no mask sparsity regularization term). See Sec. 4.3 (ablation study) in the [AdaHAT paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-70352-2_9).
        - **adjustment_intensity** (`float`): hyperparameter, controls the overall intensity of gradient adjustment (the $\alpha$ in Eq. (9) of the [AdaHAT paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-70352-2_9)).
        - **s_max** (`float`): hyperparameter, the maximum scaling factor in the gate function. See Sec. 2.4 "Hard Attention Training" in the [HAT paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/serra18a).
        - **clamp_threshold** (`float`): the threshold for task embedding gradient compensation. See Sec. 2.5 "Embedding Gradient Compensation" in the [HAT paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/serra18a).
        - **mask_sparsity_reg_factor** (`float`): hyperparameter, the regularization factor for mask sparsity.
        - **mask_sparsity_reg_mode** (`str`): the mode of mask sparsity regularization, must be one of:
            1. 'original' (default): the original mask sparsity regularization in the [HAT paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/serra18a).
            2. 'cross': the cross version of mask sparsity regularization.
        - **task_embedding_init_mode** (`str`): the initialization mode for task embeddings, must be one of:
            1. 'N01' (default): standard normal distribution $N(0, 1)$.
            2. 'U-11': uniform distribution $U(-1, 1)$.
            3. 'U01': uniform distribution $U(0, 1)$.
            4. 'U-10': uniform distribution $U(-1, 0)$.
            5. 'last': inherit the task embedding from the last task.
        - **epsilon** (`float`): the value added to network sparsity to avoid division by zero (appearing in Eq. (9) of the [AdaHAT paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-70352-2_9)).
