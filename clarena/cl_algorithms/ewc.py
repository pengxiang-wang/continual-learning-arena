    A regularization-based approach that calculates the fisher information as parameter importance for the previous tasks and penalizes the current task loss with the importance of the parameters.

    We implement EWC as a subclass of Finetuning algorithm, as EWC has the same `forward()`, `validation_step()` and `test_step()` method as `Finetuning` class.

The thing is, EWC only uses the model of the previous tasks to train current and future tasks, which aggregate them into a single model. Once the training of the task is done, the storage for those parameters can be released. However, this make the future tasks not able to use EWC anymore, which is a disadvantage for EWC.

        According to [the EWC paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1611835114), the importance tensor is a Laplace approximation to Fisher information matrix by taking the digonal, i.e. $F_i$, where $i$ is the index of a parameter. The calculation is not following that theory but the derived formula below:

        $$\omega_i = F_i  =\frac{1}{N_{t-1}} \sum_{(\mathbf{x}, y)\in \mathcal{D}^{(t-1)}_{\text{train}}} \left[\frac{\partial l(f^{(t-1)}\left(\mathbf{x}, \theta), y\right)}{\partial \theta_i}\right]^2$$

        For a parameter $i$, its fisher information is the magnitude (square here) of gradient of the loss of model just trained over the training data just used. The $l$ is the classification loss. It shows the sensitivity of the loss to the parameter. The larger it is, the more it changed the performance (which is the loss) of the model, which indicates the importance of the parameter.
