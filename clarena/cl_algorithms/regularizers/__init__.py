# Continual Learning Regularizers
This submodule provides the **regularizers** which are added to the loss function of corresponding continual learning algorithms. It can promote forgetting preventing which is the major mechanism in regularization-based approaches, or for other purposes.

The regularizers inherit from `nn.Module`.

Please note that this is an API documantation. Please refer to the main documentation pages for more information about the regularizers:
