        **Args:**
        - **root** (`str`): the root directory where the original Kuzushiji-MNIST data 'KMNIST/' live.
        - **num_tasks** (`int`): the maximum number of tasks supported by the CL dataset. This decides the valid task IDs from 1 to `num_tasks`.
        - **validation_percentage** (`float`): the percentage to randomly split some training data into validation data.
        - **batch_size** (`int` | `dict[int, int]`): the batch size for train, val, and test dataloaders.
        If it is a dict, the keys are task IDs and the values are the batch sizes for each task. If it is an `int`, it is the same batch size for all tasks.
        - **num_workers** (`int` | `dict[int, int]`): the number of workers for dataloaders.
        If it is a dict, the keys are task IDs and the values are the number of workers for each task. If it is an `int`, it is the same number of workers for all tasks.
        - **custom_transforms** (`transform` or `transforms.Compose` or `None` or dict of them): the custom transforms to apply ONLY to the TRAIN dataset. Can be a single transform, composed transforms, or no transform. `ToTensor()`, normalization, permute, and so on are not included.
        If it is a dict, the keys are task IDs and the values are the custom transforms for each task. If it is a single transform or composed transforms, it is applied to all tasks. If it is `None`, no custom transforms are applied.
        - **repeat_channels** (`int` | `None` | dict of them): the number of channels to repeat for each task. Default is `None`, which means no repeat.
        If it is a dict, the keys are task IDs and the values are the number of channels to repeat for each task. If it is an `int`, it is the same number of channels to repeat for all tasks. If it is `None`, no repeat is applied.
        - **to_tensor** (`bool` | `dict[int, bool]`): whether to include the `ToTensor()` transform. Default is `True`.
        If it is a dict, the keys are task IDs and the values are whether to include the `ToTensor()` transform for each task. If it is a single boolean value, it is applied to all tasks.
        - **resize** (`tuple[int, int]` | `None` or dict of them): the size to resize the images to. Default is `None`, which means no resize.
        If it is a dict, the keys are task IDs and the values are the sizes to resize for each task. If it is a single tuple of two integers, it is applied to all tasks. If it is `None`, no resize is applied.
        - **permutation_mode** (`str`): the mode of permutation, should be one of the following:
            1. 'all': permute all pixels.
            2. 'by_channel': permute channel by channel separately. All channels are applied the same permutation order.
            3. 'first_channel_only': permute only the first channel.
        - **permutation_seeds** (`dict[int, int]` | `None`): the dict of seeds for permutation operations used to construct each task. Keys are task IDs and the values are permutation seeds for each task. Default is `None`, which creates a dict of seeds from 0 to `num_tasks`-1.
