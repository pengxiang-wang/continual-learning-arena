    [HAT (Hard Attention to the Task, 2018)](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/serra18a) is an architecture-based continual learning approach that uses learnable hard attention masks to select the task-specific parameters.

    ResNet is a convolutional network architecture, which has 1st convolutional parameter layer and a maxpooling layer, connecting to 4 convolutional layers which contains multiple convolutional parameter layer. Each layer of the 4 are constructed from basic building blocks which are either small (`ResNetBlockSmall`) or large (`ResNetBlockLarge`). Each building block contains several convolutional parameter layers. The building blocks are connected by a skip connection which is a direct connection from the input of the block to the output of the block, and this is why it's called residual (find "shortcut connections" in the paper for more details). After the 5th convolutional layer, there are average pooling layer and a fully connected layer which connects to the CL output heads.

    Mask is applied to the units which are output channels in each weighted convolutional layer. The mask is generated from the unit-wise task embedding and gate function.

        **Args:**
        - **input** (`Tensor`): the input tensor from data.
        - **stage** (`str`): the stage of the forward pass, should be one of the following:
            1. 'train': training stage.
            2. 'validation': validation stage.
            3. 'test': testing stage.
        - **s_max** (`float` | `None`): the maximum scaling factor in the gate function. Doesn't apply to testing stage. See chapter 2.4 "Hard Attention Training" in [HAT paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/serra18a).
        - **batch_idx** (`int` | `None`): the current batch index. Applies only to training stage. For other stages, it is default `None`.
        - **num_batches** (`int` | `None`): the total number of batches. Applies only to training stage. For other stages, it is default `None`.
        - **test_task_id** (`dict[str, Tensor]` | `None`): the test task ID. Applies only to testing stage. For other stages, it is default `None`.

        **Returns:**
        - **output_feature** (`Tensor`): the output feature tensor to be passed to the heads.
        - **mask** (`dict[str, Tensor]`): the mask for the current task. Key (`str`) is layer name, value (`Tensor`) is the mask tensor. The mask tensor has size (number of units, ).
        - **activations** (`dict[str, Tensor]`): the hidden features (after activation) in each weighted layer. Key (`str`) is the weighted layer name, value (`Tensor`) is the hidden feature tensor. This is used for the continual learning algorithms that need to use the hidden features for various purposes.
