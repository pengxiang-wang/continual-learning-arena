        - **AdaHAT**: the parameter-wise measure is the parameter importance for previous tasks from the unit-wise summative mask of previous tasks `self.summative_mask_for_previous_tasks`, which is $\min \left(m_{l,i}^{<t,\text{sum}}, m_{l-1,j}^{<t,\text{sum}}\right)$ in Eq. (9) in the AdaHAT paper.
        - **CBPHAT**: the parameter-wise measure is the parameter importance for previous tasks from the unit-wise importance of previous tasks `self.unit_importance_for_previous_tasks` based on contribution utility, which is $\min \left(I_{l,i}^{(t-1)}, I_{l-1,j}^{(t-1)}\right)$ in the adjustment rate formula in the paper draft.
